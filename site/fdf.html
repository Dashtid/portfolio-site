    <h1>Platoon Leader, 2nd Lieutenant</h1>
    <p>
      The Finnish Defence Forces (Puolustusvoimat) is Finland's military organization responsible for national defense,
      with Nylands Brigad being a specialized coastal defense unit that trains marine commandos for amphibious and
      coastal operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my service with Nylands Brigad, I underwent an intensive transformation from recruit to commissioned
      officer, culminating in a leadership role within one of Finland's most demanding military units.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Training and Selection:</strong> The journey began with rigorous screening processes designed to identify
      candidates capable of handling the responsibilities and demands of marine commando leadership. These
      evaluations tested not only physical capabilities but also mental resilience, decision-making under pressure, and
      leadership potential in high-stress environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Leadership Development:</strong> Upon successful completion of the selection process and associated
      training, I was commissioned
      as a platoon leader and entrusted with command responsibilities. This role demanded organizational
      skills and stress resilience, developed through intensive military training that simulated real-world operational
      pressures. The experience taught me to maintain clear thinking and effective decision-making even under
      challenging circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Command Responsibilities:</strong> My duties encompassed both garrison and field operations, requiring
      adaptability between different operational contexts. In day-to-day garrison duties, I was responsible for the
      command and welfare of 150 soldiers, managing everything from training schedules to personnel development. During
      field
      operations, I led a specialized unit of 30 soldiers in tactical scenarios, where coordination and
      split-second decision-making were essential for mission success and personnel safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experience fundamentally shaped my approach to leadership, teaching me the importance of clear communication,
      decisive action, and maintaining team cohesion under pressure.
