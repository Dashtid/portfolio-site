      <h1>Biomedical Engineer, Radiology Department</h1>
      <p>
        Södersjukhuset is one of Stockholm's largest hospitals and a major teaching hospital within the Karolinska Institutet network, providing comprehensive healthcare services to the southern Stockholm region with a strong focus on advanced medical technology and patient care.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my tenure at Södersjukhuset's radiology department, I served as a crucial bridge between advanced medical technology and clinical operations, ensuring that complex IT systems supported optimal patient care and departmental efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>System Management and Optimization:</strong> My primary responsibility centered on managing and organizing the department's sophisticated IT infrastructure, which included PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems), DICOM protocols, and various medical imaging equipment interfaces. This role required deep understanding of both healthcare IT requirements and operational workflows, as I worked to ensure systems were not only functional but optimized for clinical efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Strategic Analysis and Procurement:</strong> I conducted comprehensive evaluations of supplier contracts, analyzing them from both economic and operational perspectives to ensure the department received maximum value while maintaining high-quality service standards. This involved understanding complex technical specifications, service level agreements, and long-term operational implications of technology investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Cross-Functional Leadership:</strong> Established and led multidisciplinary workgroups designed to align departmental initiatives with broader regional and local organizational goals. These groups brought together clinical staff, IT specialists, and administrative personnel to ensure technology implementations supported both immediate operational needs and strategic healthcare objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> Performed thorough analyses of IT systems from both operational efficiency and cybersecurity perspectives, identifying vulnerabilities and improvement opportunities in an environment where patient data protection and system reliability are paramount. This work ensured compliance with healthcare regulations including ISO 13485 standards while maintaining the high security standards required in medical environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Process Improvement and Documentation:</strong> Streamlined workflows and processes throughout the department, creating more efficient pathways for image processing, storage, and retrieval. Simultaneously maintained and updated comprehensive system documentation, ensuring knowledge transfer and accessibility for both current staff and future team members.
