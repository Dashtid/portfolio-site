    <h1>Hermes Medical Solutions</h1>
    <p>
      Hermes Medical Solutions is a specialized healthcare technology company
      focused on developing advanced software solutions for nuclear medicine,
      providing critical tools that support medical professionals in diagnostic
      imaging and treatment planning within one of medicine's most technically
      demanding specialties.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my current tenure at Hermes Medical Solutions, I serve as a
      multidisciplinary specialist ensuring that cutting-edge nuclear medicine
      software meets the highest standards of quality, regulatory compliance,
      and cybersecurity in an increasingly complex healthcare technology
      landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Regulatory Compliance and Market Access:</strong> My primary
      responsibility centers on ensuring compliance with critical regulatory
      frameworks including NIS2 (Network and Information Systems Directive) and
      ISO 27001 standards, which are essential for operating in the European
      healthcare market. I actively support market clearance processes, working
      to ensure our nuclear medicine software solutions meet stringent
      regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions. This work involves
      navigating complex regulatory landscapes while maintaining the innovative
      edge that distinguishes our products in the competitive medical software
      market.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Quality Assurance and Validation:</strong> Lead comprehensive
      Verification & Validation (V&V) activities that form the backbone of our
      quality assurance processes. This role requires meticulous attention to
      detail and systematic approach to testing, as nuclear medicine software
      directly impacts patient diagnosis and treatment decisions. I ensure that
      every software release meets both internal quality standards and external
      regulatory requirements through rigorous testing protocols and
      documentation processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technical Problem-Solving and System Integration:</strong> Leverage
      extensive experience in troubleshooting complex software systems,
      particularly those involving DICOM protocols and enterprise architectures
      that are fundamental to medical imaging workflows. My technical toolkit
      includes Windows Server 2025, Docker containerization, PowerShell scripting
      for automation, and Git for version control, with Python serving as my
      primary programming language for developing testing tools and automation
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Security and Infrastructure Management:</strong> In an era where
      healthcare cybersecurity is paramount, I focus on implementing and
      maintaining robust security measures that protect sensitive medical data
      while ensuring system performance and reliability. This involves
      continuous assessment of security vulnerabilities, implementation of best
      practices, and ensuring that our software solutions can integrate securely
      within hospital IT infrastructures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cross-Functional Collaboration:</strong> Working in a hybrid
      environment, I collaborate with development teams, clinical specialists,
      and regulatory experts to ensure that technical excellence aligns with
      clinical needs and regulatory requirements, ultimately contributing to the
      delivery of secure, high-quality healthcare solutions that advance nuclear
      medicine capabilities.
