      <h1>Technician, Engine Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Scania</strong> is a leading Swedish manufacturer of commercial vehicles, buses, and industrial engines, renowned for their commitment to sustainable transport solutions and engineering excellence in the heavy-duty vehicle industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at Scania Södertälje, I progressed from a junior technician role to a more autonomous position, developing comprehensive engineering and troubleshooting expertise over two separate engagements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Initial Role (2012):</strong> Started as part of the second-line support team, working alongside experienced engineers and technicians. Acquired fundamental troubleshooting skills and gained a thorough understanding of Scania's organizational structure and production processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advanced Role (2016):</strong> Returned in a more autonomous capacity that allowed me to further develop my engineering skills. Managed the entire troubleshooting process from case intake to resolution and reporting results to superiors. Communicated effectively across the production chain, from manufacturing line personnel to construction engineers, while gaining valuable experience in creating documentation and establishing work routines.
